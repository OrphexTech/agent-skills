# Orphex Merchant Feed Health Check

Review the supplied Merchant Center product data, destination-specific issues and matching website/checkout evidence. Eligibility issues and economic performance are different analyses.

## Establish product identity and freshness

Record merchant scope, target country/language, destination, stable item/variant ID, feed source/update, diagnostic/crawl timestamp, and site/checkout observation time. An item can have different status across destinations; keep unique item-destination rows and their denominators explicit. Do not call a partial export a complete catalog audit. Preserve account-level versus item-level issues and statuses exactly as supplied.

Check mismatches in price/currency/tax convention, availability, variant, link, required identifiers and attributes, images, and source precedence only when supporting evidence is present. Conditional identifier/variant/shipping requirements depend on product, country and destination; check current official requirements rather than inventing blanket GTIN, image-size or title rules. Do not invent identifiers or change in-stock/out-of-stock to gain eligibility.

A site observation and an eligible status can conflict because timestamps or definitions differ. Verify the exact variant, checkout and data source before calling a live regression or failed correction. Actual source errors, unsupported observations, and pending verification should be distinct. Do not fetch or modify private merchant data without the requested access scope.

## Prioritize a repair queue

Rank actual disapprovals/limited eligibility, scope, business-provided importance, freshness and repair dependencies. Historical spend/revenue may describe exposure when correctly joined; it does not predict lost or recoverable sales. Feed coverage alone cannot explain a ROAS decline or prove incremental demand.

For each issue show item/destination, evidence, source of truth to inspect, proposed repair, owner if supplied, and recheck condition after update/crawl/diagnostics. Correct the upstream source rather than recommending conflicting manual edits blindly. Appeals, feed uploads, item exclusions and price/stock changes require explicit action scope. Finish with coverage limits and untested destinations.

## Portable inputs and examples

- Read [the input contract](references/input-contract.md) when mapping a new export or checking the example's scope and definitions. Copy [the header-only CSV template](assets/input-template.csv) when preparing data; equivalent supplied exports remain acceptable.
- Read [the reusable business context](references/business-context.md) only for business facts or constraints this task needs. Reuse user-supplied facts with their source/date; the template contains no default targets.
- Inspect [the complete fictional input](assets/example-input.csv) with [its example output](references/example-output.md) when learning the output and calculation boundaries. Never use fictional values for a real account.

State whether the result is complete, partial, or blocked for the requested decision. Link material findings to actual supplied rows/sources and separate observed metrics, hypotheses, and estimates. Lead with a short business conclusion, then evidence, uncertainty, and the next measurable check. A data export or installed skill does not authorize account changes.
